## Business Problem 
When Telerik [acquired EQATEC](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/07/telerik-acquires-danish-cross-platform-app-analytics-software-maker-eqatec/) in early 2013, the company was focused on replacing the existing Silverlight-based web interface with an HTML5 and CSS3 based interface. When I joined the project, I was responsible for updating the interface design, building consistency with existing Telerik products.

## Approach 
At the onset of the project, it seemed that the goals were very simple. As the only designer on the project, I needed to work closely with the developers on the EQATEC team to update the visual design to fit with existing products. While there wasn't an existing style guide, objects were consistent enough throughout each product that I could make design decisions without having to get many people involved.

However, as the project evolved, our effort was expanded to introduce Telerik Analytics into the [Telerik Platform](http://www.telerik.com/platform). This meant that a visual redesign quickly turned into a full-blown product experience redesign. I worked with designers from across all of the Platform products to create and implement a cohesive style guide and understand how users would expect to interact with the Analytics product throughout the entire ecosystem.


### Tools Used 
* Adobe Illustrator 
* Balsamiq 
* Camtasia 
* Skype

## Outcome 
[Telerik Analytics](http://www.telerik.com/analytics) was launched on-time in early 2014 as part of the Telerik Platform unveiling. One of the largest pieces of previously non-existing functionality that I designed was the ability for users to create custom dashboards for their data.

## Lessons Learned 
This project really improved my ability to work with an international team. I worked constantly with team members both in my local office and abroad in Denmark and Bulgaria. Traveling to Bulgaria for the project kickoff allowed me to make sure I was integrated properly with the product designers for the other products involved in this project.
