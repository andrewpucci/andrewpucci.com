# Carnation City Mall Blueprints
![Carnation City Mall Blueprints](/img/carnation-blueprint.png)

## Business Problem
The Carnation City Mall website was not supplying critical information needed by its users. As part of a graduate school  study, my team was assigned to determine how the site could be of better use to their shoppers.

## Approach
The team first conducted a competitive analysis to get an understanding of how other area and model malls structure information on their websites. Using the knowledge gained from the competitive analysis, the team constructed a blueprint for the Carnation City Mall website, outlining existing and additional pages that would help customers find the information they need about the mall.

### Tools Used
* OpenOffice Draw

## Outcome
The blueprints were used to build navigation models into wireframes for a reconstructed Carnation City Mall website.

## Lessons Learned
This project gave me a better understanding of how to implement Jesse James Garrett's [visual vocabulary](http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/) for describing information architecture and interaction design.
