# My Work

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to be involved in quite a few interesting projects. I have run usability studies, constructed blueprints and wireframes for websites, created interactive prototypes, and designed mobile interfaces. Of course, this is only a small sample of my work. If you'd like to discuss these or see more, send me an [email](mailto:andrew@andrewpucci.com)!
