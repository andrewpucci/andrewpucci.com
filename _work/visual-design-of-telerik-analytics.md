## Business Problem
When Telerik [acquired EQATEC](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/03/07/telerik-acquires-danish-cross-platform-app-analytics-software-maker-eqatec/) in early 2013, it quickly became a goal to replace the existing Silverlight-based web interface with an HTML5 and CSS3 based interface. When I was assigned to the project, I was tasked with updating the interface design to match it with the design of existing Telerik products.

## Approach
At the onset of the project, it seemed that the goals were very simple. I just needed to update the visual design to fit existing products. However, as the project evolved, we realized that we were going to have to design the product to fit into the [Telerik Platform](http://www.telerik.com/platform). This meant that a simple visual redesign quickly turned into a full-blown product experience redesign.

### Tools Used
* Adobe Illustrator
* Balsamiq
* Camtasia
* Skype

## Outcome
The initial release of the [Telerik Analytics](http://www.telerik.com/analytics) service was launched on-time in early 2014 as part of the Telerik Platform release. One of the largest pieces of previously non-existing functionality that I designed was the ability for users to create custom dashboards for their data.

## Lessons Learned
This project really improved my ability to work with an international team. I worked constantly with team members both in my local office and abroad in Denmark and Bulgaria. Traveling to Bulgaria for the project kickoff allowed me to make sure I was integrated properly with the product designers for the other products involved in this project.
