# Young Professionals of Akron Usability Study

## Business Problem
A small team and I set out to determine if the current organization of the Young Professionals of Akron (YPA) website facilitates easy navigation and the simple completion of common tasks. We also wanted to identify areas for improvement specific to menu options, titles, and actions that may be completed at the YPA website.

## Approach
Scripted usability studies were performed with a set of study participants who closely matched the intended audience of the YPA website. Each participant was asked to perform three different tasks, which were recorded using Tobii Studio eye-tracking software.

### Tools Used
* Tobii Studio

## Outcome
There seemed to be three main areas of trouble for the participants: unfamiliar labels in the global navigation, standard web conventions were not followed, and elements of the page intended to be prominent were, instead, ignored. This feedback and the recommendations produced by the team were given to the YPA Board of Directors. The YPA later redesigned their website using these recommendations to help improve the interface.

## Lessons Learned
Working with the eye-tracking software allowed my team and me to see that participants were looking over important parts of the website, even though they usually managed to complete the tasks given to them. This may not have been as easy to spot had the eye-tracking heatmaps not been available.
