# Hi, I'm Andrew.

As a user experience designer, I've spent much of the past 5+ years helping clients understand how people are using their products and developing designs that increase usability.

Throughout my careeer, I've had the opportunity to work on a [wide variety of projects](/work/) in many different roles ranging from web developer, data modeler, project manager, all the way to UX Team of One.

In 2011, I graduated from the [Information Architecture and Knowledge Management (IAKM)](http://iakm.kent.edu) Master's program at Kent State University. My concentration was in User Experience Design.

Before that, I graduated from [Clarkson University](http://www.clarkson.edu) with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Information Technology.

Local professional community is important to me. I have volunteered on many area boards of directors and currently serve as the President of [UXPA Cleveland](http://www.uxpacleveland.org).

In my spare time, you can find me biking, traveling, whipping up some homebrew, watching indie films, or learning everything on Coursera.
