# Hi, I'm Andrew.

Whether interviewing business analysts to figure out which questions they need answered or designing and running surveys to understand employee engagement, I've always focused on people throughout my career.

I've been responsible for everything from web development to organization design. Having [experience](/work/) as a user experience designer, software engineer, data modeler, and culture architect has given me the ability to understand the needs of all participants in the product workflow.

In my work, I highly value the diversity of the people I work with, transparency, honesty, flexibility, life-long learning, balance, and adding value to the world.

In my spare time, you can find me experimenting with photography, traveling, watching [all the film](https://letterboxd.com/andrewpucci/), or listening to podcasts at 2.2x.

## Get in touch!
If you think any of this sounds interesting, I'd love to chat with you. Feel free to send me an email and we'll set something up!
