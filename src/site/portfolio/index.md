# My Work

As a software engineering student, I spent the better part of my senior year working with a group of colleagues on a project to help doctors diagnose Parkinsonian tremor. Not once during the project did we have access to the patients or doctors who were intended to be the users of the application. This concerned me. If I couldn't see someone using the software I was creating, how would I know it would be successful?

A year later, I was solidly into my first professional position as a web developer. I'd still not seen a person using the website I'd been working on. It was at that point that I decided I had to learn more about how people interacted with software. I found the [Information Architecture and Knowledge Management program](https://www.kent.edu/slis/information-architecture-and-knowledge-management) at Kent State University and enrolled in the Masters program in User Experience Design.

I've been putting my UX skills to work in many different ways since then, whether it was interviewing business stakeholders to understand the questions they'd had of their data to introducing a recurring survey system to help leadership at a startup understand employee engagement.

Shown below are some examples of the work I've done. I'd love to talk with you about my experience, especially if I might be able to help you with a problem you're working through. Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:hi@andrewpucci.com)!
